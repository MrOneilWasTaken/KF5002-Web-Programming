Alright so I'll be honest I tried for a while to get this to work but, I cannot for
the life of me get this part of the code to work. I've either used a wrong method
for targetting data or just completely shat the bed on the logic here. I, unforunately,
I had to give up, but I wanted to leave the code here just to show the types of ways
I tried to complete this part of the assignment. In the credits as well, there are
videos I credit that go more in depth to how the querySelector methods work but,
I just couldn't get them to target the data I needed.

Furthermore, when I did manage to target the content I needed, it wouldn't update
as I was testing it? I would input something into forename and force the console
to update and tell me what it had inside it but it would still say there was no data
e.g. null. Like okay, totally makes sense. I just couldn't solve this on my own and
gave up after a days of frustration. 

Also typed up this rant to justify me skipping it.
Sorry.
