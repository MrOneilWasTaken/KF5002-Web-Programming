The film opens on ancient native American cave drawings, while the soundtrack chants "Koyaanisqatsi" which is a Hopi indian term for "life out of balance". The film uses extensive time lapse photography (which speeds images up) and slow motion photography to make comparisons between different types of physical motion. In one of the first examples, we see cloud formations moving (sped up) intercut with a montage of ocean waves (slowed down) and in such a way we are able to see the similarities of movement between these natural forces. This technique of comparison exists throughout the film, and through it we learn more about the world around us. The film progresses from purely natural environments to nature as affected by man, and finally to man''s own manmade environment, devoid of nature yet still following the patterns of natural flow as depicted in the beginning of the film, yet in chaos and disarray.

Its original title was in reference to a famous musical that had previously been filmed three times in 1929, 1936 and in 1951 by a major Hollywood studio that protested use of the title. The plot concerns a filmmaker who needs to use a $10,000 grant for a production, and the ironic twist is that all the actors who audition sing songs and dance routines from every musical EXCEPT the one he is remaking. One of the actors is the sensationally attractive Bobby Ross (sometimes credited as Juan Damone and here as Juan Demone) whose last commercial film was a small plot-pivotal role in "And Baby Makes Six" with the late Colleen Dewhurst. His scene is warm and poignant because while singing the accompanist slyly shifts from the key of C used in rehearsal to the key of F for the camera. Bobby''s voice goes thin in the high notes and he calmly stops in the middle of the scene and admonishes the pianist with a gentle scolding, "Oh, that''s much too high!" He smiles and stares at the pianist who returns to the correct key and finishes the song. The scene is reminiscent of Joan Crawford in 1933''s "Dancing Lady" who also is sabotaged at an audition by a pianist who speeds up the tempo. The film shows up in both its original release and in a "censored" version that was shown on British television.'),
